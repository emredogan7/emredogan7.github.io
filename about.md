## me, in a nutshell:

I am currently working as a backend engineer at [Delivery Hero](https://www.deliveryhero.com/) in Berlin. Before that, I was working at [Plentific](https://www.plentific.com/en-gb/), again as a backend engineer.


I got my bachelor's degree on electrical and electronics engineering in 2018 (from [METU](https://eee.metu.edu.tr/)). The following two years, I had my master's degree in computer science at Bilkent University. In my research studies, I mostly worked on mining software artifacts to get some insights about the non-ideal processes followed during the software development lifecycle. For further details, you can see [my thesis](http://repository.bilkent.edu.tr/bitstream/handle/11693/54183/10361684.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y) and [publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0QRi1i4AAAAJ&hl=en).


I've mostly worked with Python backend stack (Django & FastAPI) so far. Additionally, I have a strong interest in system infrastructure. I possess practical experience with tools like Terraform, Helm charts, and Kubernetes, particularly within the context of Google Cloud Platform.
