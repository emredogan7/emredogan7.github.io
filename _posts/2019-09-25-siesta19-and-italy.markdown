Just wanted to share some good memories from my Italy trip in Summer'19: Termoli, Rome and Florence.


## Termoli:

I was in Termoli for SIESTA 2019 _(International Summer School on Software Engineering)_ on September 3-6.  There were great presentations on different topics. For more information about SIESTA, visit [here](https://siesta.si.usi.ch/2019/schedule).


Termoli is a small town on the South Adriatic coast of Italy, in the province of Campobasso. The city is famous for its beaches. Here are some photos from Termoli:

## Rome:
There isn't much to say about Rome. Each part of the city has its own wonders.
